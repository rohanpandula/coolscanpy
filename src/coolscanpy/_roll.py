"""The roll-feeder extension: :class:`Roll`.

Wires three concrete subsystems that exist independently in this package but
were never previously composed into one whole-roll workflow:

* :mod:`coolscanpy.roll.preview_session` -- decodes one whole-roll transport
  read into fixed-order slots, spacing-offset math, and the reviewed
  fingerprint;
* :mod:`coolscanpy.protocol.ls5000_single_pass.capture_process` --
  ``CaptureProcessAdapter``, the process-isolated batch capture engine (the
  same class the concrete test suite already drives through injectable
  ``runner``/``batch_spawner`` seams, per the hardware-free testing
  contract);
* :mod:`coolscanpy.capture.single_pass_workflow` -- decodes, quality-checks,
  and finalizes one completed attempt.

Only ``Material.COLOR_NEGATIVE``'s single-pass RGBI4 capture route
(``CaptureRoute.SINGLE_PASS_RGBI4``) is wired end to end here. See the
``scan_many`` docstring and the package README's deviations note for why
``Material.BLACK_AND_WHITE_NEGATIVE``'s SANE-based route is not.

        If this batch resumes a reservation :meth:`preview` (or a prior
        ``scan_many()``/``scan()``) left held, the *default* ending -- no
        ``eject_after``, no :meth:`safe_stop` -- is to keep that same
        reservation held afterward too: same child process, same
        reservation, same retained frame table, no RESERVE_UNIT, no
        repeated command 64, no RELEASE_UNIT. This is the vendor's own
        session shape (one reservation from feed to eject, any number of
        fine scans in between) and lets a further ``scan_many()``/``scan()``
        resume it again, indefinitely -- across as many calls as the
        caller likes -- until :meth:`eject`, an explicit :meth:`release`,
        ``eject_after=True`` ends it here, or :meth:`close`. A ``Roll``
        with no preceding ``preview()`` (or one that already
        released/ejected) has nothing to hold: that batch runs cold and
        releases immediately after, exactly as before this parameter and
        this holding behavior existed.

        ``eject_after``, when true, ends this batch by replaying the traced
        vendor end-of-session eject sequence -- still inside this batch's
        original reservation -- immediately after the last requested slot's
        frame is finalized, before releasing. This is the "I'm done with
        this roll" ending; the alternative -- this method's own default,
        described above -- leaves the strip parked inside for a later
        ``preview()``/``scan_many()``/``scan()`` or an explicit
        :meth:`eject`. A safe-stop requested mid-batch (:meth:`safe_stop`)
        always takes priority over both: an interrupted batch releases
        plainly and never ejects or stays held, regardless of
        ``eject_after``, because ending early is not "done with this
        roll." A failed eject (the traced sequence deviated -- most often
        a suspected transport wedge) surfaces as
        :class:`~coolscanpy.exceptions.FeederParked` once the iterator is
        fully consumed, exactly like any other recovery-required outcome.

        The batch itself runs on a background worker thread; each decoded
        Frame crosses back to this iterator through a bounded queue (holding
        at most one frame at a time), so the caller receives frame N as soon
        as it is ready instead of waiting for the whole ``slots`` batch to
        finish. In-flight memory stays capped at about two frames (one
        queued, one the worker is finalizing) no matter how many slots are
        requested. Abandoning the iterator early (a ``break`` out of a
        ``for`` loop, or an explicit ``.close()``) requests the same safe
        stop as :meth:`safe_stop`, drains the queue, closes the owned
        transport, and joins the worker before propagating
        ``GeneratorExit`` -- it never leaves the worker blocked writing a
        finished frame to a queue nobody is reading.

        ``exposure_override_10ns``, when given, is a ``(red, green, blue)``
        tuple of raw 10ns hardware exposure ticks (the same unit as
        ``exposures_raw_10ns``/``wire_colors_raw_10ns`` elsewhere in this
        package) that replaces the AE meter's own proposal for every frame
        in this batch -- the meter still runs its full unmodified sequence
        (same wire traffic, same passes); only the fine-scan plan built from
        its answer is substituted. ``None`` (the default) is today's
        behavior: the meter's own accepted values are used, byte-identical
        to a Roll built before this parameter existed. IR has no override
        concept and always uses the metered value. Every frame's receipt
        and evidence record both the metered and the forced values plus an
        explicit ``applied`` flag; ``receipt.exposure`` itself reflects the
        forced ticks actually used.

        Only ``Material.COLOR_NEGATIVE`` (single-pass RGBI4) is implemented;
        a ``Material.BLACK_AND_WHITE_NEGATIVE`` Roll raises
        ``NotImplementedError`` here (see the module docstring). Argument
        validation (slot range, required approvals, material route,
        exposure override bounds) happens eagerly, before any hardware
        access; the actual batch runs lazily as the returned iterator is
        consumed.
