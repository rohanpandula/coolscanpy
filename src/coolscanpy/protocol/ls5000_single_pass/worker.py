    Fail-closed policy: a parity calculation error refuses the fine scan with
    a named error — never a silent fallback to the active RGB solve, which
    would silently reintroduce the +6-9% brightness family this authority
    exists to close (RESULT-FINE-EXPOSURE-DOMAIN-20260731).  A guarded
    candidate outside the scanner's [EXPOSURE_MIN, EXPOSURE_MAX] contract is
    clamped to the device bound — one more named, journaled guard, matching
    the ceiling the scanner itself enforces — so thin or dim frames stay
    scannable exactly as they were under the active controller.
