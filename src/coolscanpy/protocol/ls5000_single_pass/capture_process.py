"""Process-isolated bridge to NegPy's proven LS-5000 RGBI4x capture worker.

The package owns and integrity-pins the USB worker. This adapter gives the
application a narrow, fail-closed process boundary around it:

* every launch uses an argv list (never a shell command),
* both the worker and bundled replay plan are hash-pinned before launch,
* preview attempts expose the scanner's addressable candidates without a
  count hint, while meter attempts capture one explicit scanner slot,
* selected full frames share one child/reservation and cross a durable
  frame-ready/parent-ACK boundary before the next frame starts, and
* a stop request is observed only at a safe frame boundary.  An active child
  is never signalled or killed by this adapter.

The worker's ``--preview-only`` operation persists the roll preview and 0x8e
table before any frame binding.  Exposure-count labels are not part of this
interface: the adapter never emits ``--expected-frame-count``.
