"""Rung 4 (FEEDING-UX-LADDER-OVERNIGHT-20260807.md): driver-side manual frame
placement for the LS-5000 whole-roll pipeline.

This module never runs film movement and never re-derives detection with
relaxed knobs.  It accepts an already-decoded whole-roll preview raster (from
a preview attempt that has already completed and released the device) plus
the boundary rows a human picked by looking at that raster, and turns those
picks into the same ``RollDetection``/``TransportMapping`` shape the
automatic detector in ``roll_index.py`` produces -- so every downstream
consumer (``preview_session.py``, the worker's live-scan binding, the app's
thumbnail/approval UI) keeps working unchanged.

Trust model (rewritten 2026-08-08 after adversarial review rejected the
original): the human supplies frame positions; this module keeps every
physical sanity check the scanner can still make from its own evidence --
clear-film transmission near the picked rows (snap assist only; never a hard
requirement) and the same-traversal transport table's local physical-motion
consistency (a hard requirement).  A placement that fails any hard check is
refused in its entirety: this module never returns a result that accepted
some picks and silently dropped others.

The transport-table check used to mean "every single-row step within 3 rows
of a pick must be 40..45 native units."  Real LS-5000 live READ(0x8e) tables
never satisfy that: they carry a deterministic ~18-row code lattice (see
``transport_native_origin`` in roll_index.py) whose per-row steps are mostly
an exact, steady rate but include a recurring minority of large single-row
jumps at selector rollovers (roughly +798/-700 native units) and smaller
jumps at sub-rollovers (the code's high byte advancing alone), averaging
back out to the steady rate over any run of a dozen-plus rows.  A ±3-row
window is on the wrong side of that: it is wide enough to *catch* a rollover
row but too narrow to *outvote* it, so it refused nearly every real capture
at the very first edge with a message ("try refeeding the strip") that could
not have been fixed by refeeding, because nothing was wrong with the strip.

The fix is the same class of machinery ``roll_index.derive_transport_mapping``
already uses for the automatic path: resolve each pick's origin from a local
affine fit over nearby table records -- robust to that lattice's own minority
of outlier rows -- rather than trusting one raw row read.  See
``_resolve_boundary_transport_origin`` for exactly how, and why it mirrors
two different ``derive_transport_mapping`` conventions depending on whether a
narrow, specific clear-film run backs the pick.  ``derive_transport_mapping``
itself is still never called: it requires >=3 "direct"-support boundaries
classified from automatic detection's own lattice fit, which no user-picked
boundary ever carries, and it owns the automatic path's exact behavior,
which nothing in this rework may change.

    # either refuses per frame or, if a caller wrongly granted rebase, keeps
    # a displaced origin (see worker.py's origin_rebase_allowed /
    # origin_rebase_slots computation for the other half of that fix, which
    # this rework also closes -- manual placements are no longer eligible

    # frame. What validates a 2-boundary placement is gate 4 (each pick's
    # own local neighborhood proves internally affine) and gate 5 (the one
    # pairwise implied scale between the two picks); there is no third,
    # independent boundary to cross-check either pick against, so a
    # systematic table shift confined entirely between the two picks -- one
    # that neither pick's own local window sees and that still lands inside
    # the 40..45 pairwise scale band -- is not detectable from two points,
    # full stop, no matter how this module is written. Documented here
    # rather than silently pretended away with a gate that would always
    # pass anyway.

    # Fit against each boundary's RESOLVED lookup_row, for the same reason
    # gate 5 just switched to it: lookup_row is the row this placement's

    # true regardless of which resolution path (narrow-run trailing edge vs
    # broad-region forward search) picked each lookup_row. Fitting the
    # visual pick rows instead would fold each path's own few-row read
    # offset into the residual alongside genuine table drift, and a
    # placement that mixes both paths (e.g. a leader-adjacent first
    # boundary next to ordinary narrow inter-frame gaps -- an entirely
    # ordinary manual placement) would then show a spurious drift this gate
    # would wrongly refuse on. NativeFrameOrigin.boundary_output_row is set
